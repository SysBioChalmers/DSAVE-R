#'
#' DSAVE scores from public datasets evaluated with the standard template.
#' Can be used for comparison against the score generated to see if it is
#' comparable to scores from other datasets.
#'
#' @format list of lists, where the inner list contains the dataset name (as named
#' in the DSAVE publication) and the DSAVE score.
#' @source Calculated with the DSAVE-M package in MATLAB, but the results should
#' be the same.
