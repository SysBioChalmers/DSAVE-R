#' Dissecting Cell-to-Cell Variation in Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data
#'
#' R Package DSAVE, Down-SAmpling based Variation Estimation. The package is useful for comparing the variation in single-cell RNA-Seq data
#' that does not originate from sampling, defined as BTM variation, between cell populations. The package supports
#' comparing variation across datasets and can be used as a quality metric, where the variation can be compared
#' to that of other datasets from similar conditions.
